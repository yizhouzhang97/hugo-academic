I am a Ph.D. student advised by Prof. Yan Liu at the Department of Computer Science, Viterbi School of Engineering. My research interests mainly focus on Graph Representation Learning and Time Series and their application to social science and natural science. Before that, I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Peking University. During my undergraduate time, I researched with Prof. Guojie Song on Graph Representation Learning. I also spent a summer in MILA for short research advised by Prof. Jian Tang.
